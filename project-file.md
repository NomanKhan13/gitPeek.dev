# GitHub User Search

A simple project to search for GitHub users and view their profile details and repositories.

## ðŸ§¾ User Stories

1. **Search Functionality**  
   As a user, I want to search for a GitHub username so that I can view that user's profile information and repositories.

2. **User Profile Information**  
   As a user, I want to view key details of the searched userâ€”including:

   - Full name
   - Username
   - Account creation date
   - Number of public repositories
   - Followers count
   - Following count
   - Location
   - Twitter handle
   - Personal website (portfolio)
   - Company (currently working at)  
     So that I can better understand who they are and what they do.

3. **List of Repositories**  
   As a user, I want to see a list of the user's public repositories so that I can explore the kind of projects they have worked on.

4. **Load More Repositories**  
   As a user, I want to see a "View More Repositories" button so that I can load and view all of the user's repositories if they have many.

5. **Repository Details**  
   As a user, I want to be able to view complete details of a selected repositoryâ€”including:
   - Description
   - Topics/tags
   - Stars
   - Forks
   - Last updated date
   - Link to the code on GitHub  
     So that I can evaluate the project more deeply.
